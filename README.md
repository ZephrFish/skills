# SpecterOps Skills

Reusable agent skills, plugins, and agent definitions for SpecterOps.

## Role/Profile Installer

Install an opinionated Skills OS role/profile for Codex with the `uv`-run installer:

```bash
uv run scripts/skills-os.py list-profiles
uv run scripts/skills-os.py show research
uv run scripts/skills-os.py install research
```

The installer resolves profile inheritance, installs required Codex plugins, and offers a checkbox selector for optional agents. Selected agents are copied to `~/.codex/company/agents/` and registered in `~/.codex/config.toml`.

See [`docs/profile-installer.md`](docs/profile-installer.md) for dry-run, GitHub source, and non-interactive examples.

## Use With Claude Code

Each plugin lives under `plugins/<name>/` and includes a Claude Code manifest at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

For local development:

```text
/plugin marketplace add /Users/<user>/Projects/skills
/plugin install <plugin-name>@specterops-skills
```

For a hosted repository:

```text
/plugin marketplace add SpecterOps/skills
/plugin install <plugin-name>@specterops-skills
```

## Use With Codex

Each plugin includes a Codex manifest at `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`.

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add /Users/<user>/Projects/skills
# or
codex plugin marketplace add SpecterOps/skills
```

Then open Codex and install from `/plugins`.

### Codex MCP setup

Codex officially supports MCP servers through declarative `mcp_servers` configuration. This repository no longer ships MCP runner or first-run installer scripts. Install or clone each external MCP server yourself, then point Codex at that server with `command`, `args`, and optional `env` values in `~/.codex/config.toml` or project `.codex/config.toml`.

1. Install or refresh this marketplace in Codex:

   ```bash
   codex plugin marketplace add /Users/<user>/Projects/skills
   # or
   codex plugin marketplace add SpecterOps/skills
   ```

   Then install the relevant plugins from `/plugins`.

2. Configure MCP servers directly in Codex. Example BloodHound and Ghostwriter stdio configurations:

   ```toml
   [mcp_servers.bloodhound_mcp]
   command = "uv"
   args = ["--directory", "/path/to/bloodhound-mcp", "run", "main.py"]

   [mcp_servers.bloodhound_mcp.env]
   BLOODHOUND_DOMAIN = "YOUR_DOMAIN"
   BLOODHOUND_TOKEN_ID = "YOUR_TOKEN_ID"
   BLOODHOUND_TOKEN_KEY = "YOUR_TOKEN_KEY"
   BLOODHOUND_SCHEME = "https"
   BLOODHOUND_PORT = "443"

   [mcp_servers.ghostwriter]
   command = "uv"
   args = ["--directory", "/path/to/GhostWriterMCP", "run", "python", "-m", "ghostwritermcp.server"]

   [mcp_servers.ghostwriter.env]
   GHOSTWRITER_URL = "https://ghostwriter.example.com/"
   GHOSTWRITER_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
   GHOSTWRITER_CA_BUNDLE = "/path/to/ca-bundle.crt"
   GHOSTWRITER_OPLOG_ID = "123"
   GHOSTWRITER_OPERATOR = "your-callsign"
   GHOSTWRITER_SOURCE_IP = "10.0.0.5"
   ```

3. Configure Binary Ninja MCP with the command or endpoint documented by your BinjaMCP installation. For stdio servers, the Codex shape is:

   ```toml
   [mcp_servers.binary_ninja_mcp]
   command = "npx"
   args = ["-y", "binary-ninja-mcp", "--host", "localhost", "--port", "9009"]
   ```

Restart Codex after changing MCP configuration, then confirm the tools appear under `/mcp` before relying on MCP-assisted skills.

## Use With npx skills

Use `npx skills` when you only want to install skill instructions. This does not install full plugin behavior such as MCP config, Claude commands, hooks, or agent definitions.

```bash
npx skills add SpecterOps/skill --list
npx skills add SpecterOps/skills --skill <skill-name> --agent claude-code --agent codex --global
```

For local testing:

```bash
npx skills add /Users/<user>/Projects/skills --list
```

## Standalone Skills

No standalone skills currently live under `skills/` in v2.

Moved during Skills OS v2 implementation:

- `planning-collab-brainstorm` -> [`plugins/base-planning/skills/planning-collab-brainstorm/`](plugins/base-planning/skills/planning-collab-brainstorm/)
